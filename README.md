# Poker-Hand-Evaluator
## Application Description
This is an C# console app that takes the concepts and simple gameplay flow of simple poker. 
The app uses a collection of Card objects with contain a symbol (suits) and a value of the card ranging from Ace/1 - King 
(the order of the card value goes from 2-10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace being at the top).
The application will generate two arrays of 5 card collection of objects that is later used to compare which hand of the two is
better based on the general rules of poker and display the results on screen with a simple check to redo the process again.
## Questions/Concerns
Question 1: What sort of ways could I optimize the code?

Question 2: What version of poker would you like to see with this code as its basis?

Question 3: What sort of suggestion there be a good suggestion on what to do on the basis have having more than two players compare each other instead?
